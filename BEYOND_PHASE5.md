# Beyond Phase 5 — Long-Term Research Roadmap

This document defines the long-term iterative roadmap for Project Comfy after the completion of the initial Core Blueprint (Phases 1–5).  
These iterations are intended to run indefinitely, continuously refining the android’s mechanical, electrical, software, interaction, and autonomy systems.

Each iteration focuses on a single high-impact improvement area and produces:
- A research log  
- A focused study or prototype  
- Simulation or analytical validation  
- Updated reference files  
- A next-iteration proposal  

This roadmap is not a strict sequence; the project may move non-linearly depending on research results.

# Infinite Extension

Iterations may continue well beyond 50+.  
The structure supports:

- constant optimization  
- experimental branches  
- community-led research  
- parametric CAD improvements  
- new control architectures  
- new materials and actuators  
- “variant builds” (compact, premium, ultra-safe, low-cost)  
- research notebooks  
- alternative digital twin implementations  
- regulatory and compliance planning  

The project is designed to evolve indefinitely as an open research platform.

# Contribution Expectations

All new iterations **must** include:
- A research log  
- A focused single-topic study  
- Simulation or analysis validation  
- A summary and next-step proposal  
- Traceability to previous work  

This ensures the project remains coherent across years of development.
