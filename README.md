# Project Comfy

**Project Comfy** is an open research and design initiative focused on the **development of a domestic android for human companionship**.  
The project’s goal is to create a complete, transparent blueprint for an affordable, safe, and emotionally intelligent humanoid system — including its **mechanical design, electronics, control software, and behavioral architecture**. Based on the posts of the /robowaifu/ imageboard at alogs.space.

## Overview

Project Comfy is being developed through a structured, multi-phase design and engineering process led by an autonomous agent (Manus) and human collaborators.  
Each phase refines the previous one — from abstract requirements to tangible, buildable systems.  
Although divided into numbered phases, development is continuous and iterative. Each milestone becomes a foundation for deeper refinement and more advanced exploration.

**Core Design Principles**
- Safety-first motion and actuation  
- Modular and serviceable construction  
- Realistic human interaction without deception  
- Localized AI architecture emphasizing privacy and transparency  
- Open documentation for replicability and educational use

## Current Phase

**Phase 3 — Prototyping and Integration** *Completed*

Project Comfy now includes detailed prototype-ready assets and integration procedures, enabling the construction of a functional demonstrator.  
The project is prepared to move into **Phase 4: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Evaluation and Refinement**, which will focus on behavioral development, emotional modeling, and human interaction testing.

**Phase 4 Goals**
1. Develop adaptive personality and mood modeling  
2. Calibrate motion, gaze, and verbal synchronization  
3. Conduct comfort and empathy interaction testing  
4. Implement long-term behavioral safety mechanisms

## Technology Focus

- **Control Systems:** Field-Oriented Control (FOC) and compliance modeling  
- **Computation:** Distributed microcontrollers with centralized high-level cognition  
- **AI Architecture:** Layered design (Reflex → Behavior → Personality)  
- **Interaction:** Speech, gesture, and emotional state simulation  
- **Power:** 24V modular PMU with hot-swappable cells  
- **Networking:** Real-time CAN bus and Ethernet-based supervision

## Continuing Development

Following Phase 5, Project Comfy will continue as an open-ended research effort.  
Subsequent work will focus on refinement, simplification, and optimization across all subsystems.

**Late-Stage Research and Improvement Goals**
- **Cost Minimization:** Reducing total system cost through simplified assemblies and component substitution.  
- **Part Reduction:** Consolidating mechanical and electronic components for easier fabrication and repair.  
- **Capability Enhancement:** Improving dexterity, perception, and energy efficiency while maintaining prior design constraints.  
- **3D Model Integration:** Translating all blueprint designs into parametric CAD models for inspection, modification, and simulation.  
- **Scale Optimization:** Evaluating anthropometric trade-offs between different robot heights and mass distributions (e.g., five-foot vs. six-foot designs).  

These areas will form the foundation for ongoing research and community collaboration beyond the original design scope.
