# Project Comfy

**Project Comfy** is an open research and design initiative focused on the **development of a domestic android for human companionship**.  
The project’s goal is to create a complete, transparent blueprint for an affordable, safe, and emotionally intelligent humanoid system — including its **mechanical design, electronics, control software, and behavioral architecture**. Based on the posts of the /robowaifu/ imageboard at alogs.space.

## Overview

Project Comfy is being developed through a structured, multi-phase design and engineering process led by an autonomous agent (Manus) and human collaborators.  
Each phase refines the previous one — from abstract requirements to tangible, buildable systems.  
Although divided into numbered phases, development is continuous and iterative. Each milestone becomes a foundation for deeper refinement and more advanced exploration.

**Core Design Principles**
- Safety-first motion and actuation  
- Modular and serviceable construction  
- Realistic human interaction without deception  
- Localized AI architecture emphasizing privacy and transparency  
- Open documentation for replicability and educational use

## Current Phase

**Phase 4 — Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Evaluation and Refinement** *Completed*

Project Comfy now includes a complete behavioral and emotional interaction model, ensuring natural, ethical, and safe human–robot companionship.  
The next phase, **Phase 5: Production and Open Reference Platform**, will consolidate all work into a unified, replicable blueprint suitable for physical construction, research, and open publication.

**Phase 5 Goals**
1. Integrate all prior subsystem documents into a single coherent platform  
2. Produce complete fabrication and assembly documentation  
3. Finalize firmware and software packaging for release  
4. Conduct full safety and compliance validation  
5. Publish an open reference platform for public and academic use

## Technology Focus

- **Control Systems:** Field-Oriented Control (FOC) and compliance modeling  
- **Computation:** Distributed microcontrollers with centralized high-level cognition  
- **AI Architecture:** Layered design (Reflex → Behavior → Personality)  
- **Interaction:** Speech, gesture, and emotional state simulation  
- **Power:** 24V modular PMU with hot-swappable cells  
- **Networking:** Real-time CAN bus and Ethernet-based supervision

## Continuing Development

Following Phase 5, Project Comfy will continue as an open-ended research effort.  
Subsequent work will focus on refinement, simplification, and optimization across all subsystems.

**Late-Stage Research and Improvement Goals**
- **Design Consolidation:** Reduce complexity and part count without loss of function.  
- **Manufacturing Accessibility:** Adapt assemblies for small-lab or hobbyist fabrication.  
- **Capability Enhancement:** Improve dexterity, perception, and energy efficiency within current design limits.  
- **Digital Twin Development:** Create a complete 3D parametric model for simulation and inspection.  
- **Scale Optimization:** Evaluate ergonomics, efficiency, and comfort across size variants.  

These areas will form the foundation for ongoing research and community collaboration beyond the initial design scope.
