# Project Comfy

**Project Comfy** is an open research and design initiative focused on the **development of a domestic android for human companionship**.  
The project’s goal is to create a complete, transparent blueprint for an affordable, safe, and emotionally intelligent humanoid system — including its **mechanical design, electronics, control software, and behavioral architecture**. Based on the posts of the /robowaifu/ imageboard at alogs.space.

## Overview

Project Comfy is being developed through a structured, multi-phase design and engineering process led by an autonomous agent (Manus) and human collaborators.  
Each phase refines the previous one — from abstract requirements to tangible, buildable systems.

**Core Design Principles**
- Safety-first motion and actuation
- Modular and serviceable construction
- Realistic human interaction without deception
- Localized AI architecture emphasizing privacy and transparency
- Open documentation for replicability and educational use

## Current Phase

**Phase 2 — Subsystem Specification and Validation** *Completed*

Project Comfy has now defined its hardware, electronics, and software at an engineering level.  
The next phase, **Phase 3: Prototyping and Integration**, will focus on creating build-ready assets including CAD, PCB, and firmware prototypes.

**Upcoming Phase Goals**
1. Fabrication-ready mechanical and electrical designs  
2. Integrated firmware and high-level control software  
3. Bench and HIL (hardware-in-loop) testing  
4. Safety and personality model validation

## Technology Focus

- **Control Systems:** Field-Oriented Control (FOC) and compliance modeling  
- **Computation:** Distributed microcontrollers with centralized high-level cognition  
- **AI Architecture:** Layered design (Reflex → Behavior → Personality)  
- **Interaction:** Speech, gesture, and emotional state simulation  
- **Power:** 24V modular PMU with hot-swappable cells  
- **Networking:** Real-time CAN bus and Ethernet-based supervision
