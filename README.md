# Project Comfy

**Project Comfy** is an open research and design initiative focused on developing a **domestic android for human companionship**.  
The goal is to create a complete, transparent blueprint for an affordable, safe, stable, and emotionally intelligent humanoid system — including its **mechanical design, electronics, control software, safety systems, and HRI behavior models**.

This work is based on the collective knowledge of the */robowaifu/* imageboard on alogs.space, combined with structured agentic development through Manus and human oversight.

## Overview

Project Comfy evolves through a structured, multi-phase engineering process.  
The intention is not to produce a commercial robot, but a **research-grade open reference platform** for robotics laboratories, hobbyists, and long-term humanoid development projects.

Core design values include:

- Safety-first control and actuation  
- Modular and serviceable construction  
- Transparent, non-deceptive interaction behavior  
- Local-first AI and cognition  
- Open documentation for reproducibility and community contribution  
- Long-term extensibility beyond the initial design

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into major development milestones:

### **1. Core Blueprint (Phases 1–5)**
A complete foundation for the android’s design, including:

- Requirements and design philosophy  
- System architecture (mechanical, electrical, cognitive)  
- CAD and fabrication guidelines  
- Firmware and control system references  
- HRI behaviors, safety logic, and personality modeling  
- Consolidated production-ready blueprint  

All foundational research documents from these phases are stored in their respective folders.

---

### **2. Beyond Phase 5 — Iterative Research Cycles**
Ongoing optimization through structured iterations, each targeting a specific improvement area.

Completed iterations include:

#### **Iteration 1 — Cost & Accessibility Engineering**
Low-cost actuator redesign (cycloidal drive), contribution guidelines, and research-log structure.

#### **Iteration 2 — Digital Twin Integration**
Creation of the parametric CAD structure, URDF/SDF simulation models, and ROS2 control bridge.

#### **Iteration 3 — Structural Optimization & Mass Reduction**
Topology simplification, material substitution, center-of-mass refinement, and improved ankle stability.

#### **Iteration 4 — Control & Firmware Refinement**
Adaptive FOC tuning, dynamic balancing, improved latency, and safer MCU-side control logic.

#### **Iteration 5 — HRI Sensor Fusion & Tactile Integration**
Tactile sensing systems, multimodal fusion, contact intent inference, and digital-twin validation.

*(Iteration 6 and onward will be added to the repository as they are completed.)*

## Current Development Status

**Active Phase:** Beyond Phase 5 – Iteration 6  
**Focus:** Power System Optimization and Dynamic Power Management

The android’s mechanical structure, control system, and HRI behavior model are now deeply refined.  
Current work focuses on improving runtime, thermal stability, and power allocation under real workloads.

## Long-Term Roadmap

The project is intended to continue well beyond Phase 5, with future research including:

- Improved autonomy and local cognition  
- Further cost minimization and part reduction  
- Advanced manufacturing accessibility  
- Multi-scale body variants (height/mass optimization)  
- Durable long-life materials and endurance testing  
- Full digital-twin robotics experimentation  
- Potential modular ecosystem (hands, shells, sensors)

A companion roadmap document (`BEYOND_PHASE5.md`) provides an extended outline of future development directions.
